To master the topics for your aptitude test in 60 days, I'll create a detailed day-wise study plan tailored to cover Logical Reasoning, Data Interpretation, Reading Comprehension, Numerical Ability, Current Science & Technology, Problem Solving & Decision Making, and Behavioral & Interpersonal Skills. The plan assumes you can dedicate 3–4 hours daily, balancing theory, practice, and review, while progressively building skills. Each week will include a mix of topics to keep learning dynamic and avoid burnout, with periodic assessments to track progress.

### Assumptions:
- You have basic familiarity with these topics but need structured practice to achieve mastery.
- You can study 3–4 hours daily (adjustable based on your schedule).
- The aptitude test requires both speed and accuracy, so practice will emphasize timed exercises.
- Resources: Access to aptitude test prep books (e.g., R.S. Aggarwal for Quantitative Aptitude and Logical Reasoning, Arun Sharma for Data Interpretation), online platforms (e.g., IndiaBIX, PrepInsta), and current affairs sources (e.g., The Hindu, science magazines, or apps like Inshorts).
- Behavioral & Interpersonal Skills will focus on understanding concepts and practicing situational responses, as these are often tested via case studies or interviews.

### Study Plan Overview:
- **Duration**: 60 days (July 7, 2025, to September 5, 2025).
- **Daily Commitment**: 3–4 hours, split into 2–3 sessions (e.g., 1.5 hours in the morning, 1.5–2 hours in the evening).
- **Weekly Structure**:
  - 6 days of study + 1 day for review/assessment.
  - Each day covers 2–3 topics to ensure variety and retention.
  - Focus on theory and concepts in the first 3 weeks, transitioning to intensive practice and timed tests in the last 5 weeks.
- **Key Strategies**:
  - Use flashcards for formulas and current affairs facts.
  - Practice 20–30 questions per topic daily in the practice phase.
  - Take mock tests weekly in the final 3 weeks to simulate exam conditions.
  - Reflect on mistakes daily by maintaining an error log.
