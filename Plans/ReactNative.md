Mastering React Native for mobile development requires a structured approach, combining foundational knowledge, hands-on practice, and real-world application. Below is a detailed plan to learn React Native, tailored for beginners to intermediate learners, with resources and a clear progression path. The plan assumes you have basic programming knowledge (JavaScript or similar) and covers learning React Native, building projects, and preparing for professional development. The timeline is flexible but assumes 3-6 months of consistent effort (10-15 hours/week).
